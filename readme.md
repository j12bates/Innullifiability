# Innullifiability
This project is an attempt to learn more about a very specific mathsy-
feeling problem I came across playing an arithmetic game with a friend.
I'm not sure if it really has much to do with maths, and it could very
well be thoroughly in the 'computing' side of things. But I'm trying to
find a bunch of solutions, essentially, and try and find patterns and
interesting things.

Here's the problem written out very concisely: Find a set of positive
integers from which it is impossible to construct an arithmetic
expression, using each value only once, that evaluates to zero. Here, an
arithmetic expression can utilize bracketing, addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division in the case where no remainder is
generated.
